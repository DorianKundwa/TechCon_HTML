      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Since its inception, TechCon has brought together technologists, entrepreneurs, and researchers to share
        breakthroughs and best practices. What started as a small community meetup has grown into a global
        gathering that spans multiple tracks and hands-on labs.
